You have to go to `library` tab in the google credentials and actually enable sheets

To edit scopes (as in read/write for sheets) you have to either add the scope on app creation (just look for sheets in the search filter), or click `oauth consent screen` on the side bar, and then `Edit App` next to your app's name on the page.
